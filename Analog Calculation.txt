calculation for Analog Clock with Vishal Vishwakarma

This is the calculation for Clock rotatation, if you have any question please mension me. I can explain for you.

h=hours hands
m=minutes hands
s=seconds hands


If m hands rotates 60 minutes = 1 hrs(360 degree)
then, 60 min= 360 degree
1 min= 6 degree (so, minute hands rotates 6 degree for completing 1 minute)
m min= 6 degree minutes
so, 6*mtime

if s hands rotates 360 degree= 1 min
then, 60 sec= 1 min
60 sec= 360 degree
1 sec= 6 degree
s sec= 6 degree seconds
so, 6*stime



If h hands rotates 12 hrs=360 degree
then, 12 hrs=360 degree
1 hrs=360/12 = 30 degree 
60 min= 30 degree
1 min= 1/2 degree
m=m/2 degree rotates
so, h hrs= (30 degree hours +m/2)
:: m/2 is a mintue hands calculation, Let assume the time is 01hrs:30min, then the h hands show in the middle of 1-2.
and m hands show in 30. 
therfore, we also want minute hands calculation to rotates our h hands
so, 30*htime +m/2
